3. Run the game by executing the `main.rb` script: `ruby main.rb`.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter player names and symbols ('X' or 'O').

## Parameters

This project doesn't require any external parameters or dependencies to run. It only uses the Ruby programming language standard library.

## Features

- Two players can take turns to play the game.

- It checks for win conditions and declares a winner.
- It checks for a tie when the board is fully occupied.
- After each game, players have the option to play again.

## What I Used

- Ruby programming language.
- Object-oriented programming concepts to design and structure the game logic.
- Loop structures to manage player turns and the game loop.
- Command-line interface to interact with players.
- Git version control to manage the project's codebase.

## What I Learned

- Object-oriented design and separation of concerns.
- Implementing game logic with classes and methods.
- Utilizing loops for game flow control.
- Validating user inputs and handling user interactions.
- Displaying information in a user-friendly format.
- Incorporating user options and replay functionality.
